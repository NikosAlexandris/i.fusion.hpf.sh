# HPF Resolution Merge  --- Attempt to replicate in GRASS GIS

  # Function to combine high-resolution panchromatic data with lower resolution
  # multispectral data, resulting in an output with both excellent detail and
  # a realistic representation of original multispectral scene colors.
  
  # The process involves a convolution using a High Pass Filter (HPF) on the
  # high resolution data, then combining this with the lower resolution
  # multispectral data. Read the description of the Algorithm below.

# The general algorithm is:

  # 1. Read pixel sizes from Image files and calculate R, the ratio of
  # multispectral cell size to high-resolution cell size
  
  # 2. Apply the High-pass filter to the high spatial resolution image.
  
  # 3. Resample the Multi-Spectral image to the pixel size of the high-pass image.
  # Note, bilinear resampling required (4 nearest neighbours)!
  
  # 4. Add the HPF image weighted relative to the global standard deviation of
  # the Multi-Spectral band.
  
  # 5. Optionally, stretch linearly the new HPF-Sharpened image to match the mean and
  # standard deviation of the input Multi-Sectral image.
